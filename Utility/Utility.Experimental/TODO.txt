- Cyclic buffers (with timed access)
    - Stream version
- Blocking queue, stack
- Copy files with temporary backup
- Allow stride in array segments (allow items to be between "rows")
- Merge ArrayBuffer and ArrayAccess
- Unions: AnyOf<T1, T2, T3, ...>
    - use index to encode which value it was. Specially handle default case (index = 0)
    - implicit conversion of
        - T1, T2, ...
        - AnyOf<T1, T2, ..., T[n]> to AnyOf<T1, T2, ..., T[n], ...>
        - AnyOf<S1, ..., S[k], AnyOf<T1, ..., T[n]>, S[k+1], ..., S[m]> to AnyOf<S1, ..., S[k], T1, ..., T[n], S[k+1], S[m]> and vice versa
